# XML to TEXT using GO templates
## This project has been moved to [BaFi](https://mmalcek.github.io/bafi/)

- Reason: it's no longer just for XML but it now supports various input formats and allow output in almost any format So it can translate averything like [Babel Fish](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Babel_Fish) :)
- This repo will soon be deleted!
